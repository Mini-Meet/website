        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <span>
          OptimizeMe products are designed to help you improve remote team
          culture through our suite of digital tools & professional advice based
          on years of experience within the field of remote HR.
        </span>
        <br />
        <h3>Our Products</h3>
        <span>
          OptimizeMe products are developed by Scribe Services Ltd., a limited
          company based in London, United Kingdom, and operated by our team
          based between London & Berlin. Our website (team.optimizeme.app), as
          well as our sub-domains (such as this one) are run by our internal
          team. We use third party services to build our products, keep in touch
          with customers and to help us understand how we can improve our
          products through analytics data. Many of those services collect data
          about you, our customers, but we aim to also be as explicit and
          transparent as possible when this is the case. As such, below we
          outline precisely what those services are, how we use them, as well as
          how we store & utilise any data those services provide. For any
          questions, please reach out to Henry, our Head of Product & Co-founder
          directly, at henrylatham5555@gmail.com. If you contact OptimizeMe by
          e-mail, we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments. We
          may ask for your name, e-mail address and contact information in order
          to send you a reply.

        <h3>Data used by our website</h3>
        <span>
          We have custom built our website, but run our servers & all domains on
          Netlify. Regarding your data, we use a service called Mixpanel to
          allow us to anonymously track general user behaviour (such as the
          percentage of visitors who click a download button) in order to
          improve the website and understand how effective it is in conveying
          what our company does & how it provides value to our customers and
          potential customers. For any advertising campaigns we run through
          Google, we also anonymously track users who interact with that
          advertising campaign, through to downloading our products and whether
          they end up paying for it or not.
        </span>

        <h3>Data Used By Our Products</h3>
        <span>
          All of the information entered in our products, such as your email or
          written data, is visible within our products. However, this personal
          data is only visible within the product when a user is logged in,
          using the email address they used on sign up, and have entered their
          secure password. That information cannot be seen by anybody other than
          the account owner within our products itself. As you use our products,
          we collect analytics data using Mixpanel, a data analytics service.
          With Mixpanel, we use the following data: 1. Information about your
          device and city location 2. Information about specific steps taken in
          our products (such as how often a customer writes a journal entry) 3.
          Information about general user behaviour of the entire user population
          We use this data on a regular basis to determine how to improve our
          product (with the objective of getting users to increase happiness &
          reduce suffering through regular journaling). We also use Mixpanel
          from time to time to contact customers through the email address they
          used upon sign up, with product updates or with free resources we
          think will help you improve your team culture.
          <b>However</b>, let us be very clear on this: We take privacy very
          seriously & work hard to find a balance between your privacy & our
          desire to continuously improve our products.

        <h3>What if I want to delete my data</h3>

          swiftly to delete any data stored on our services. Please contact
          Henry, our Head of Product & Co-founder directly if this is the case:
